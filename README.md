# Let's sail! (Mockup sign-up form)

[Github Pages](https://nathoggles.github.io/Sign-up-to-sailing/)

This is a dummy sign-up form. My goal was to train my intermediate CSS and HTML skills, particularly in using pseudo-elements, CSS variables and in styling and validating forms with RegEx patterns. Besides the JS used for checking that passwords match, all validation and custom error messaging is achieved with pure HTML and CSS. 

The site is also a base for a future authorization project.

*In contrast to my other projects, this project for now is optimized for desktop only.
